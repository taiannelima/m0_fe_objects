# Self-Evaluation

- WThis final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

**I believe that with the undertanding, plus a little bit o research on things I could have been struggling with, I felt ready to start Mod1, the challenges I faced made me go deeper on undertanding it so it kinda helped me. I like challenges.**


- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

**pretty good. i have prepped myself for the new adjustments and everything. Waking up earlier, and making tiny changes. all good**


- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?

**the "SyntaxCleanUp"" brings me peace after reoginizing it, and i'm taking that with me**
